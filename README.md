SIRFindeR: Stable Estimation of Intron Retention levels from RNA-seq data
============================================================================

SIRFindeR is an R package for quantifying Intron Retention levels using Second Generation RNA-Sequencing data.

## Package installation 

So as to install SIRFindeR in a R session from GitHub, you will need the R package *devtools*. 
You can install it using:

```

install.packages("devtools")
   
```
Then, install SIRFindeR with:

```

devtools::install_github("lbroseus/SIRFindeR")
   
```
